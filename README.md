<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- osTicket

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

- [osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation](https://github.com/nikocapp56/osticket-prereqs)
- [osTicket - Post-Installation Configuration](https://github.com/nikocapp56/post-install-config)

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Steps</h2>

<h3> Overview of Ticket Workflow and Role Interaction </h3>

- Create tickets as an end-user.
- Respond to tickets as a Help Desk Agent.
- Set priorities, assign SLAs, and observe ticket visibility limitations.
- Work tickets to resolution and review system behavior.


<h3> Ticket Scenario: Mobile/Online Banking System Down </h3>

Go to the End User Ticket Submission URL: http://localhost/osTicket

Create a ticket as end-user, Karen.

</p>
Go to the Admin Login URL: http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php
</p>
Log in as Agent John.

<img width="800" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25faebb5-0dae-43eb-a67f-70a2724d5353" />

Open the ticket and figure out how severe the issue is, then route it to the right team.

Since the ticket is banking-related, assign it to the Online Banking team. I‚Äôm also updating the SLA plan to Sev-A since this has a big impact on the business. I changed the help topic to 'Business Critical Outage' and added some notes to help the Online Banking team handle it better.

Set priorities, assign SLAs, and observe ticket visibility limitations.

Work tickets to resolution and review system behavior.
Handle as: Agent John
Observe ticket properties: Priority, Department, SLA, Assigned To
Set:
SLA: Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7)
Department: Online Banking
Try to view/edit again as John. Can you?
Resolve as: Agent Jane


üìå Ticket 2: Adobe Upgrade Needed
Create as: End-user
Subject: Accounting department needs Adobe upgrade (broken)

Handle as: Agent John

Observe ticket properties

Set:

SLA: Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)

Department: Support

Resolve the ticket as John

üìå Ticket 3: CFO‚Äôs Laptop Not Turning On
Create as: End-user
Subject: CFO‚Äôs laptop will no longer turn on

Handle as: Agent John

Observe ticket properties

Set:

SLA: Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7)

Department: Support

Resolve the ticket as John

üö® Escalation Behavior
Set Sev-A (SysAdmins ticket) last.

Ticket becomes inaccessible to agent without permission.

Switch to Admin Panel ‚Üí Assign View access to SysAdmins role.

Return to Agent Panel ‚Üí Observe escalated ticket (now viewable, but not editable).

üì¨ Ticketing System Behavior
Most ticketing systems, including osTicket, support email notifications:

When a ticket is created or updated, the end user receives an email copy.

End users can reply via email, and their response gets attached to the ticket.

üßë‚Äçüíª Real-World Ticket Intake
Tickets can come from:

Web forms

Email

Phone calls

Chat apps

In-person requests

üí° Even if you fix something on the spot, create a ticket. This helps with:

Tracking

Accountability

Metrics reporting

SLA compliance

üîÅ Final Thoughts and Practice

Re-do the lab multiple times until it becomes second nature.
